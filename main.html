	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>As a Computer Science student, I developed an interest in programming when I started learning languages like Java and building small projects. I enjoy solving problems using logic and seeing my code turn into working applications. Becoming a developer allows me to apply my technical knowledge, continuously improve my skills, and build useful software. I am especially motivated by the opportunity to learn new technologies and grow in a field that values problem-solving and innovation.</p>
